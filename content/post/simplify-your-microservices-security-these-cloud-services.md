I recently wrote an article for TechBeacon where, among other things, I made the case that microservices security can be enhanced and made easier by adopting a "serverless-first" approach.

If security is important to you but you have neither time nor desire to turn it into your (or somebody else's in the team) primary concern, then you should consider adopting at least some of the services and approaches that I suggest in the article.

You can read the full article here:
