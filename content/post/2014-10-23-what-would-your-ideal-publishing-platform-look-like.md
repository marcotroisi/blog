I have been struggling for a while with finding the right CMS and/or publishing platform. All of them seem to have good parts and less good parts, and that is okay. In a (possible, potential) future attempt of myself to try building the _right_ publishing platform, I have decided to list some of the things that it seems to me people would usually look for in a CMS or a blogging platform. I would like as many people as possible to select in the poll below what are the things that would make them choose a publishing platform over another.<!--more-->

Hopefully this will result, one day, in the publishing platform that we all have always dreamed of!

Thank you for your time!

**UPDATE**: the poll has now been removed from this page
