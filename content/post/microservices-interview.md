A few weeks ago, after giving a talk at PHP Dublin, I was interviewed by the fine folks from the [UXDX](https://uxdxconf.com/) conference.

The topic of the interview was **"When to use microservices"**. It was partly inspired by the talk I gave that very night. In the interview, I do my best to define what microservices are and when should companies adopt them. I then proceed to give insights as to how to succeed from both a code quality and a project management point of view.

UXDX is a conference that will run in Dublin, Ireland, on November the 2nd, 2016. The event's goal is to *focus on improving the team behind the product*. There will be a set of great speakers from some of the best companies in Ireland and not only. If you can go, you shouldn't miss it. You can get your tickets [here](https://uxdxconf.com/#/tickets).

This is the video of the inteview. It's less than 7 minutes long, but I think it contains some interesting points which you might want to look into.
