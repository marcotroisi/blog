As I needed to create some custom XMLs for a project I am working on, I have created an Yii extension based on a nice class being developed by <a href="http://simonwillison.net/" target="_blank">Simon Willison</a>.

Using this extension, everyone will be easily able to generate an XML. I am pretty sure there may be different and even more powerful approaches to do the same thing, but what I like of this extension is that it does make really simple to create a custom XML. And, sometimes, simple is better -especially when it means less time to do the same thing!

If you&#8217;ve never used an extension with the Yii framework, you may find useful to read the &#8216;extensions&#8217; section on the Yii framework official website: <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/1.1/en/extension.overview" target="_blank">http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/1.1/en/extension.overview</a>.
