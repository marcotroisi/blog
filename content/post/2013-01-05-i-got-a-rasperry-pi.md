Yes, I&#8217;ve got it!

After more or less 3 weeks of waiting, I can finally put my hands on my new, shiny **Raspberry PI**!<img alt="Raspberry PI" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cb/Raspberry_Pi_Logo.svg" width="0" height="0" />  And I have to say I had lose any hope to get it before 2013, but, unexpectedly, it got to my house just a few hours before 2012 came to the end.

**Rasp-what?
  
** Just in case you have never heard about it (if so, please consider starting to sometimes read at least the <a title="BBC Tech" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology/" target="_blank">Tech section</a> of the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/" target="_blank">BBC news</a> website, because it is completely unacceptable for a geek not to be aware about the Raspberry PI! :P), the Raspberry PI _&#8220;is a credit-card-sized single-board computer developed in the UK by the Raspberry Pi Foundation with the intention of stimulating the teaching of basic computer science in schools.&#8221;_ (source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).

**So, what&#8217;s so great about it?
  
** The great thing about the Raspberry PI, is that it is a _full Linux PC_ (with very low performances, as you might expect) and **_it costs just 35$_** for its Model B-version, which is better equipped (Model A is -in my opinion- simply not enough, without regarding of what you use it for).

One of the main things I see programmers doing with the Raspberry PI is **_playing_**. Having fun with it, experimenting anything their imagination can produce (as long as that small device can do it &#8211; don&#8217;t forget it is a very small PC).

So, what I am doing with it in these days is to **set up a full LAMP server**, and I will post in the next days how to do it (it&#8217;s quite simple).

There are also a few other things I want to try it for, like using it as a **backup server** (adding to it an external HD), or as a **media centre** (with the help of <a title="Raspbmc" href="http://www.raspbmc.com/" target="_blank">Raspbmc</a>). And I am sure new ideas (even for business) about how to use it will come to my mind in the next weeks.
