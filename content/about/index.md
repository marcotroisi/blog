I am a software engineer mainly involved with web development, with team leading experience. I love learning and experiencing new things, and I see software development – and technology as a whole – as a way for people to get things done more easily and faster.

I am currently a Senior Product Engineer at [Wayflyer](https://www.wayflyer.com). Prior to that, I was the Lead Engineer of the *Bot Building team* at [ServisBot](https://servisbot.com), where we built a conversational AI platform that was **100% serverless**. I have worked in Johannesburg (South Africa), Milan (Italy) and Berlin (Germany) for several different companies/organisations. 

I am a certified *__AWS__ Solutions Architect Professional*, *Solutions Architect Associate*, and *Developer Associate*. 

If you want to meet up and have a chat, discuss a project or ask me for help, please do not hesitate to [contact me](https://www.marcotroisi.com/contact/).
