I am a software engineer mainly involved with web development, with team leading experience. I love learning and experiencing new things, and I see software development – and technology as a whole – as a way for people to get things done more easily and faster.

I am currently the Lead Engineer of the *Bot Building team* at [ServisBot](https://servisbot.com), where we're building an amazing conversational AI platform that's **100% serverless**.

Before that, I have worked in Johannesburg (South Africa), Milan (Italy) and Berlin (Germany) for several different companies/organisations. 

I am a certified *__AWS__ Solutions Architect Professional*, *Solutions Architect Associate*, and *Developer Associate*.
