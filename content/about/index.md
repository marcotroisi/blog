Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve been working in tech for almost 15 years, taking on various roles such as Software Engineer, Tech Lead, Cloud Architect, CTO, and Cloud Consultant. 

Iâ€™ve designed cloud solutions, led teams, and developed a lot of software.

Iâ€™ve gained valuable experience at companies like Rocket Internet, ServisBOT, and Trilo. I enjoy the structure of big companies but am truly passionate about the energy and creativity found in startups.

I specialise in serverless architectures within the AWS cloud, a field where I've dedicated over 7 years of my career. This specialisation is not just my work; it's my craft.

Away from the keyboard, I march to the beat of a different drumâ€”quite literally. As a former drummer in a prog-rock band, I understand rhythm, whether in music or code. I start my day by making a cup of specialty coffee using my <del>V60</del> Clever Dripper.

I'm an insatiable reader with a penchant for the profound and the thrilling, delving into the realms of philosophy, history, religion, and the occasional spy novel.

I believe that life is a continuous learning process, and I bring this ethos into every project I undertake. Let's connect and create something remarkable together.

If you want to meet up and have a chat, discuss a project or ask me for help, please do not hesitate to [contact me](https://www.marcotroisi.com/contact/).
