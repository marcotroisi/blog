I am a software engineer mainly involved with web development, with team leading experience. I absolutely love learning and experiencing new things, and I see software development &#8211; and technology as a whole &#8211; as a way for people to get things done more easily and faster.

I am currently working as a software developer at a startup in Berlin, Germany. Before that I have worked in Pisa (Italy), Johannesburg (South Africa) and then Milan (Italy) for several different companies/organisations. I also occasionally freelance for small projects and contribute to [open source][2] projects.

If you want to meet up in Berlin and have a chat, discuss a project or ask me for help, please do not hesitate to [contact me][3].
