I have recently written a couple of articles for **[Milk & Honey Mag][1]**, which is a lifestyle magazine for women.
  
[<img class="size-medium wp-image-199 alignright" alt="Milk & Honey Mag" src="http://www.marcotroisi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mh_screenshot-300x161.png" width="300" height="161" srcset="http://www.marcotroisi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mh_screenshot-300x161.png 300w, http://www.marcotroisi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mh_screenshot-1024x551.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />][1]

The articles that I have written for them so far are:

  * **[Chromebook from Google: smaller than a laptop, more useful than a tablet][2]**
  
    Here I try to give an overview of what a [Chromebook][3] is, and what are the differences between it and the devices that everyone already knows (laptops, tablets, etc.).
  
    Since I am addressing an audience composed mostly by women, I am also focussing on the &#8220;cool factor&#8221;, as it seems to me that for a tech product to succeed, having the best combination of software and hardware put together is just not enough; for a product to become a must-have, a great design and a solid, recognisable brand are also necessary.</p> 
  * **[Scribd is like Netflix for ebooks][4]**
  
    A quick introduction and overview of [Scribd][5], a new, interesting service that allows you to read millions of ebooks just by paying a small monthly subscription.

I hope you will enjoy reading these articles. Let me know what do you think about them, I&#8217;d be more than happy to hear from you!

**UPDATE (1st July 2014): Milk & Honey Mag is currently under mantainance and will be launched in a completely new format in the next weeks.**

**2nd UPDATE (January 2015): Milk & Honey Mag is not going to be relaunched as we knew it before.**
