&lt;p&gt;Hello! ðŸ‘‹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve been working in tech for almost 15 years, taking on various roles such as Software Engineer, Tech Lead, Cloud Architect, CTO, and Cloud Consultant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve designed cloud solutions, led teams, and developed a lot of software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve gained valuable experience at companies like Rocket Internet, ServisBOT, and Trilo. I enjoy the structure of big companies but am truly passionate about the energy and creativity found in startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I specialise in serverless architectures within the AWS cloud, a field where I&amp;rsquo;ve dedicated over 7 years of my career. This specialisation is not just my work; it&amp;rsquo;s my craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Away from the keyboard, I march to the beat of a different drumâ€”quite literally. As a former drummer in a prog-rock band, I understand rhythm, whether in music or code. I start my day by making a cup of specialty coffee using my V60, which is a thoughtful process for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m an insatiable reader with a penchant for the profound and the thrilling, delving into the realms of philosophy, history, religion, and the occasional spy novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that life is a continuous learning process, and I bring this ethos into every project I undertake. Let&amp;rsquo;s connect and create something remarkable together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to meet up and have a chat, discuss a project or ask me for help, please do not hesitate to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.marcotroisi.com/contact/&#34;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
