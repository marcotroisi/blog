      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been struggling for a while with finding the right CMS and/or publishing platform. All of them seem to have good parts and less good parts, and that is okay. In a (possible, potential) future attempt of myself to try building the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; publishing platform, I have decided to list some of the things that it seems to me people would usually look for in a CMS or a blogging platform. I would like as many people as possible to select in the poll below what are the things that would make them choose a publishing platform over another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this will result, one day, in the publishing platform that we all have always dreamed of!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time!&lt;/p&gt;
