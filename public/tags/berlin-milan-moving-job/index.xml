      <description>&lt;p&gt;And so here we are. After less than a year of marriage, my wife and I are relocating to a new Country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been living in Milan, Italy since we got married, and, I will admit, we have loved the city. Milan is, as I often say, the Italian idea of what a metropolis would be. While it has all the characteristics of a modern European city, it is also very, very Italian. It is a city definitely worth visiting and a lovely place to work and live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berlin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from September the 1st I am going to be working in Berlin, Germany for a very big international IT company that has its headquarters in the German capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are absolutely thrilled by this new opportunity and we had actually been looking at going to live in a bigger European city for a while, so this job opportunity does indeed come as a sort of &amp;#8216;answer&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be working with lots of extremely skilled professionals, which makes the whole thing very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Berlin does look like an impressively dynamic city, with many creative people and a start up culture that is probably second to none in Europe. And somehow I find the German culture quite fascinating, so I am happy that I&amp;#8217;ll be able to learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Germany, here we come!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.: if you happen to come to Berlin in the next months and you have anything interesting to share, feel free to drop me a line and I will be happy to have a coffee with you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
