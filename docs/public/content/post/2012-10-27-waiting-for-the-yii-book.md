It&#8217;s about a month ago that I came to know that <a href="http://www.larryullman.com" target="_blank">Larry Ullman</a>, a web programmer and writer of wonderful tutorials/books, was about to write a <a href="http://www.larryullman.com/2012/09/12/yii-2-and-the-yii-book/" target="_blank">new book</a> on the <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com" target="_blank">Yii framework</a>, my favourite PHP framework at all.

While there&#8217;s no doubt I will be one of the firsts to buy it, I suggest to everyone interested in (and/or actually involved with) programming with PHP and using a framework to make your webapps more stable, simple to keep updated (especially if you work with a team) and stable, to read Larry&#8217;s incredibly clear and well written &#8220;<a href="http://www.larryullman.com/series/learning-the-yii-framework/" target="_blank">Learning Yii framework</a>&#8221; series on his blog. Should you like it, you may consider to buy his next to be published book.<!--more-->

The Yii framework was created by Qiang Xue, a developer previously involved in the Prado framework. _«Yii is a free, open-source Web application development framework written in PHP5 that promotes clean, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="nofollow">DRY</a> design and encourages rapid development. It works to streamline your application development and helps to ensure an extremely efficient, extensible, and maintainable end product.»_ (source: <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/about/" target="_blank">yiiframework.com/about/</a>).
