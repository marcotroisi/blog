I am definitely amongst the growing group of developers that are fascinated and thrilled by [node.js][1], its thriving community, its being simple yet powerful, super-fast and scalable.

Although my main language remains [PHP][2] (mostly because my employer wants me to work with it, but also because of its enormous libraries collection and its maturity as a language for the web), I can undoubtedly see a future with most of the cool apps out there being developed with node.js. I am convinced that, should I start a new project of my own today, a project that I believed would conquer the market, I would totally go for a lightweight HTML5 + CSS3 + JS (with the help of [Angular.js][3]) interface backed by a powerful node.js (with [express.js][4])-based API.

So when I came to know about this new, elegant and lightweight blogging platform named [Ghost][5] and based on node.js I was more than happy and I thought it was just what we needed to be _finally_ set free from WordPress! But I then worked out that I was almost surely wrong.

## WordPress is a CMS, not a blogging platform

While it still remains the best blogging platform out there, as of today [WordPress][6] is a fully fledged CMS and, in my opinion, it&#8217;s the best CMS you might desire. It&#8217;s simple enough to use and it&#8217;s got so many [plugins and extensions][7] that to call it an ecosystem wouldn&#8217;t mean overrating it. And, to be fair, the fact that it&#8217;s based on PHP means that it can run virtually everywhere with the minimum effort required.

## Ghost is what it claims to be: _just a blogging platform_

Ghost is beautiful, easy to use and it&#8217;s got everything in the right place. The dashboard is right the one that you would love to have in your WordPress blog. And it&#8217;s seriously fast, and you would expect that since it&#8217;s built on node.js. But it&#8217;s limited to blogging and they ([the developers][8]) want it to be so. That&#8217;s great indeed, but it means that you have to be sure that your blog will always be just a blog, nothing more. And you&#8217;ve got to know that, apart from the pleasure of a great platform for writing, you&#8217;re not going to have a lot more in terms of functionalities and extensions. Of course they&#8217;ll come in the future, but we can easily say that in the foreseeable future they won&#8217;t be as many as WordPress.

## Conclusion/Verdict

They&#8217;re both great platforms, WordPress being a lot more mature, Ghost being still in its infancy. Just don&#8217;t think of them as one replacing the other. They do different things, and they both work. Decide _what your website is gonna be about_ and then pick the right platform for you!
