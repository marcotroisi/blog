I recently found a very interesting and relevant blog/magazine for web developers: <a title="A List Apart" href="http://www.alistapart.com/" target="_blank">A List Apart</a>.

&#8220;A List Apart Magazine&#8230; explores the design, development, and meaning of web content, with a special focus on web standards and best practices.&#8221; (from http://www.alistapart.com/about/).

It seems to be a very well written magazine, and there are more than a few interesting articles, in my opinion. Not surprisingly, what I like more are the articles about the responsive design best practices.

I believe this is one of the bookmarks every web developer should add to his browser!
